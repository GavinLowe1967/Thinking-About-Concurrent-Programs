\chapter{Conditions and Signals} 

\input{conditions1} % introduction, partial queues (unbounded, bounded)
\input{conditionsChan} % many-many channel
% The following example should be adapted to use Monitors/QueueM.  However,

\heading{Other languages}

Most other languages provide a mechanism similar to conditions.  For example
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementations of the Java interface
  |java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|;

\item C++ |condition_variable|s.
\end{itemize}
%
Note that both of the above may suffer from spurious wake-ups.
