\begin{question}
\emph{Hamming numbers} are numbers whose only prime factors are $2$, $3$,
and~$5$.  Hence the first few Hamming numbers are:
\[ \mstyle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16.
\]
Thus each Hamming number is either~$1$, or an earlier Hamming number
multiplied by~$2$, $3$, or~$5$.

The Hamming numbers can be produced by a circuit as depicted below.

\draw[->] (tee4) -- (mult5);

\draw[->] (mult5) |- (merge1);
\draw[->] (mult3) -- (merge1);
% merge with (*2)
\draw (mult2) ++ (0,-2) node[draw] (merge2) {\scalashape merge};
\draw[->] (merge1) -- (merge2);
\draw[->] (mult2) -- (merge2);

The |prefix 1| and |tee| components are as in Figure~\ref{fig:NatsCircuit}.
The |merge| components are as in Exercise~\ref{ex:merge}.  The |*2|, |*3|,
and~|*5| components multiply their inputs by~$2$, $3$ and~$5$, respectively.
Thus the |prefix 1| component sets things going; the |*2|, |*3|, and |*5|
components produce appropriate multiples; and the |merge| components merge the
streams together.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the circuit using synchronous channels.  You will find that
  the system deadlocks.  Why is this?

\item Adapt the network to use buffered channels where appropriate.  Is finite
  buffering enough?

\item Adapt the network so that it produces outputs only up to some given
  maximum value, and then terminates cleanly.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{answerI}
I produce the system (for the final part) as follows.  The |*2|, |*3|,
and~|*5| components are simply instances of~|map|.
%
\begin{scala}
def system(out: !![Int], max: Int) = {
  val h0, h1, h2 = new SyncChan[Int]     // Inputs into £tee£ components.
  val i2, i3, i5 = new SyncChan[Int]     // Inputs into £*2£, £*3£, £*5£.
  val t2, t3, t5 = new UnboundedBuffChan[Int] // Outputs from £*2£, £*3£, £*5£.
  val m1, m2, m3 = new SyncChan[Int]    // Outputs from £merge£s and £takeWhile£.
  prefix(1, m3, h0) || tee(h0, i2, h1) || tee(h1, i3, h2) || tee(h2, i5, out) ||
  map((x:Int) => 2*x, i2, t2) || map((x:Int) => 3*x, i3, t3) || 
  map((x:Int) => 5*x, i5, t5) ||  
  merge(t2, t3, m1) || merge(t5, m1, m2) || 
  takeWhile((x: Int) => x <= max, m2, m3)
}
\end{scala}

The system without buffering deadlocks, basically because there are too many
intermediate values passing round the system for the various components to
hold.  In a bit more details, suppose the |prefix| component has just passed
a value~$n$.  Then the |*2| component will have output most of the Hamming
numbers less than $2n$; I say ``most'', because there might be a couple of
Hamming numbers either still in the |*2| component or the previous |tee|
component.  But that means that most of the Hamming numbers between $n$
and~$2n$ have to be stored somewhere in the subcircuit between the |*2| and
|prefix| components---and there simply isn't enough capacity for all of them.  
I use a buffered channel for the output from the |*2| component to store
them.  In fact, the number of Hamming numbers between~$n$ and~$2n$ tends to
infinity as $n$ tends to infinity, so we need an unbounded buffer.  The same
is true for the |*3| and |*5| components. 

To achieve termination, I inserted a |takeWhile| component just before the
|prefix| component---but it could have been inserted pretty much anywhere.  We
also adapt each component to close its output channels when its main loop
terminates, and also arrange for the |takeWhile| and |merge| components to
close their input channels; the latter is necessary, or else we can get into a
situation where one of those components is trying to send to another, but the
latter has terminated, so the network is deadlocked.  There's no harm in
\emph{every} component closing its input channels.
