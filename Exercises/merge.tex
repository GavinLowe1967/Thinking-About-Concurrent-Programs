\label{ex:merge}
Create a component with the signature
\begin{scala}
  def merge(left: ??[Int], right: ??[Int], out: !![Int])
\end{scala}
which receives ascending streams of data on its input channels (each without
repetition), and merges them into a single ascending stream (again without
repetition).
\end{questionS}

\begin{answerS}
My code is below. 
\begin{scala}
  def merge(left: ??[Int], right: ??[Int], out: !![Int]) = thread("merge"){
    // Invariant: £l£ is the last value read from £left£; £r£ is the last value read from
    // £right£.
    var l = left?(); var r = right?()
    repeat{
      if(l < r){ out!l; l = left?() }
      else if(l == r){ out!l; l = left?(); r = right?() }
      else{ out!r; r = right?() }
    }
  }
\end{scala}
If one of the input channels closes, this simply terminates.  Arguably, the
component should continue to pass data from the input channel that is still
open, although that requires maintaining some extra state, recording whether
the values in~|l| and~|r| have been output yet.
